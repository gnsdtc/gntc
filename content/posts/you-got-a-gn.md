Hey there ðŸŒ™

Someone sent you a **GN.TC** â€” short for **Good Night, Take Care**.  
Itâ€™s a simple, digital way to send warmth before the day ends.  
No ads, no noise â€” just a reminder that someone thought of you kindly.

ðŸ’Œ **GN.TC** is our way of bringing back small, human gestures to the internet.  
Something personal, soft, and real â€” even in a chat bubble.

If that made you smile, you can pass it on:  
ðŸ‘‰ Just type **gn.tc** in your message before you say good night.  
Itâ€™ll link back here automatically. Simple as that.

Sleep well. Take care. And if itâ€™s night where you are â€”  
**Good Night ðŸŒƒâœ¨**
